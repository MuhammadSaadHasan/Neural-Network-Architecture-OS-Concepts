# Neural-Network-Architecture-OS-Concepts
An operating system that implements a neural network architecture using separate
processes and threads on a multi-core processor. The system uses inter-process communication
through pipes for exchanging information such as weights and biases between processes. Each layer of
the neural network should be represented as a separate process, and each neuron within a layer should
be treated as a separate thread. During backpropagation, the error signal is propagated backward
through the layers of the network while utilizing the processing power of multiple cores.

## Detailed Description
Neural networks are a popular machine learning technique that mimics the structure and function of the
human brain to solve complex problems. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of neurons,
where each neuron takes input from multiple sources, processes it, and produces an output signal.

In a multi-core processor, there are several processing units (cores) that can execute multiple threads
simultaneously, thereby increasing the system's overall processing power. To take advantage of this
capability, the proposed operating system should utilize multi-core processing to parallelize the
computation of the neural network.

Each layer of the neural network should be represented as a separate process, and each neuron within a
layer should be treated as a separate thread. These threads can be assigned to different cores of the
processor to enable parallel processing of the inputs.

The operating system should provide a mechanism for inter-process communication (IPC) through pipes
to exchange information between processes. Weights and biases, which are the parameters that the
neural network learns during training, should be exchanged through these pipes.

During training, the system should use a batch-based approach, where the input data is divided into
smaller batches and each batch is processed by a separate layer in the network. Each layer should receive
its input batch from the previous layer through a pipe and then apply the weights and biases to generate
the output. The output should be passed to the next layer as input through another pipe.

During backpropagation, the error signal should be propagated backward through the layers of the
network, and the system should update the weights and biases based on the calculated gradients. You
could also use shared memory for backward propagation of weights and bias. To utilize the processing
power of multiple cores during backpropagation, the system should divide the computation into smaller
tasks and assign each task to a different core.

Furthermore, backpropagation includes:
* Process Synchronization: The system should ensure that only one process accesses the shared
resources such as weights and biases at any given time to avoid race conditions. This can be
achieved using synchronization primitives such as semaphores or locks.
* Memory Management: The operating system should provide a mechanism for allocating and
deallocating memory for the neural network processes and threads. The system should also
ensure that each process and thread has access to its own memory space to avoid conflicts.
* Inter-Process Communication: The operating system should provide a mechanism for inter-
process communication (IPC) through pipes or other forms of communication to exchange 
information such as weights and biases between processes during backpropagation.
* Thread Management: The system should manage threads efficiently to allow parallel processing
of inputs and reduce the overall training time of the neural network.
* Process Scheduling: The operating system should schedule processes and threads efficiently to
ensure that the neural network training process runs smoothly and efficiently.
